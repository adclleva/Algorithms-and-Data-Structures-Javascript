# Stacks

## OBJECTIVES
- Define what a stack is
- Understand use cases for a stack
- Implement operations on a stack data structure

## WHAT IS A STACK?
- A LIFO data structure!

- The last element added to the stack will be the first element removed from the stack

## HOW IS IT USED?
- Think about a stack of plates, or a stack of markers, or a stack of....anything.

- As you pile it up the last thing (or the topmost thing) is what gets removed first.

## WE'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE
The Call Stack!

## WHERE STACKS ARE USED
- Managing function invocations
- Undo / Redo
- Routing (the history object) is treated like a stack!

THERE IS MORE THAN ONE WAY OF IMPLEMENTING A STACK
