# BIG O of STACKS
Insertion -   O(1)
Removal -   O(1)
Searching -   O(N)
Access -   O(N)

Stacks prioritizes insertion and removal from the beginning.
We don't really search or try to access since we would use arrays for that case

## RECAP
- Stacks are a LIFO data structure where the last value in is always the first one out.
- Stacks are used to handle function invocations (the call stack), for operations like undo/redo, and for routing (remember pages you have visited and go back/forward) and much more!
- They are not a built in data structure in JavaScript, but are relatively simple to implement
- Insert and remove are both O(1)
