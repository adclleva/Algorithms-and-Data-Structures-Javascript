# ARRAYS
Ordered lists!

let names = ["Michael", "Melissa", "Andrea"];
let values = [true, {}, [], 2, "awesome"];

## WHEN TO USE ARRAYS
When you need order
When you need fast access / insertion and removal (sort of....)

## Big O of Arrays
Insertion -   It depends.... (if it's being in the end or beginning of an array)

Removal -   It depends....(if it's being in the end or beginning of an array)

Searching -   O(N)

Access -   O(1)

Let's see what we mean by that!
