# DATA STRUCTURES

## WHAT DO THEY DO?

Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data

## WHY SO MANY???

Different data structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) are more generally used.

## WHY CARE?

- The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures
- You've already worked with many of them unknowingly!
- And of course...INTERVIEWS

### THERE IS NO ONE "BEST" DATA STRUCTURE

### They all excel in different situations... Otherwise why bother learning them all??

- <strong>Working with map/location data?</strong>

  - Use a graph!

- <strong>Need an ordered list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and end?</strong>

  - Use a linked list!

- <strong>Web scraping nested HTML?</strong>

  - Use a tree!

- <strong>Need to write a scheduler? </strong>
  - Use a binary heap!
