# Big O of Sorting Algorithms

| Algorithm      | Time Complexity (Best) | Time Complexity (Average) | Time Complexity (Worst) | Space Complexity |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| Bubble Sort    | O(n)                   | O(n^2)                    | O(n^2)                  | O(1)             |
| Insertion Sort | O(n)                   | O(n^2)                    | O(n^2)                  | O(1)             |
| Selection Sort | O(n^2)                 | O(n^2)                    | O(n^2)                  | O(1)             |

## Recap

- Sorting is fundamental!
- Bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort are all roughly equivalent
- All have average time complexities that are quadratic
- We can do better...but we need more complex algorithms!
