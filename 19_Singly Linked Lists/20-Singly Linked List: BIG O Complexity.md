# Big O of Singly Linked Lists

- Insertion - O(1)

- Removal - It depends.... O(1) or O(N) for the worst case

- Searching - O(N)

- Access - O(N)

## RECAP

- Singly Linked Lists are an excellent alternative to arrays when insertion and deletion at the beginning are frequently required
- Arrays contain a built in index whereas Linked Lists do not
- The idea of a list data structure that consists of nodes is the foundation for other data structures like Stacks and Queues
