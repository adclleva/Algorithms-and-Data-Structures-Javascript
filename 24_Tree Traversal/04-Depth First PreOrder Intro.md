# DFS - PreOrder
## Steps - Recursively

- Create a variable to store the values of nodes visited
- Store the root of the BST in a variable called current
- Write a helper function which accepts a node
  - Push the value of the node to the variable that stores the values
  - If the node has a left property, call the helper function with the left property on the node
  - If the node has a right property, call the helper function with the right property on the node
- Invoke the helper function with the current variable
- Return the array of values
