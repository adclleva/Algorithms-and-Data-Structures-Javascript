# DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING

# A Light Introduction

## OBJECTIVES

- Define what dynamic programming is
- Explain what overlapping subproblems are
- Understand what optimal substructure is
- Solve more challenging problems using dynamic programming

## WTF IS DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING

"A method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions."

### IT ONLY WORKS ON PROBLEMS WITH... OPTIMAL SUBSTRUCTURE & OVERLAPPING SUBPROBLEMS

## OVERLAPPING SUBPROBLEMS

A problem is said to have overlapping subproblems if it can be broken down into subproblems which are reused several times

# FIBONACCI

"Every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones"

# OPTIMAL SUBSTRUCTURE

A problem is said to have optimal substructure if an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems

# ENTER DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING

"Using past knowledge to make solving a future problem easier"
