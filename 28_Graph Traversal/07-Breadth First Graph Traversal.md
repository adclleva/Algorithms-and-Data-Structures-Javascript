# BREADTH FIRST
Visit neighbors at current depth first!

## BREADTH FIRST Psuedo Code
- This function should accept a starting vertex
- Create a queue (you can use an array) and place the starting vertex in it
- Create an array to store the nodes visited
- Create an object to store nodes visited
- Mark the starting vertex as visited
- Loop as long as there is anything in the queue
- Remove the first vertex from the queue and push it into the array that stores nodes visited
- Loop over each vertex in the adjacency list for the vertex you are visiting.
- If it is not inside the object that stores nodes visited, mark it as visited and enqueue that vertex
- Once you have finished looping, return the array of visited nodes
