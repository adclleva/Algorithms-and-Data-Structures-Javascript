# DFS PSEUDOCODE
(iterative)
```
DFS-iterative(start):
    let S be a stack
    S.push(start)
    while S is not empty
        vertex = S.pop()
        if vertex is not labeled as discovered:
            visit vertex (add to result list)
            label vertex as discovered
            for each of vertex's neighbors, N do 
                S.push(N)
```

## DEPTH FIRST TRAVERSAL

- The function should accept a starting node
- Create a stack to help use keep track of vertices (use a list/array)
- Create a list to store the end result, to be returned at the very end
- Create an object to store visited vertices
- Add the starting vertex to the stack, and mark it visited
- While the stack has something in it:
  - Pop the next vertex from the stack
  - If that vertex hasn't been visited yet:
    - â€‹Mark it as visited
    - Add it to the result list
    - Push all of its neighbors into the stack
- Return the result array
