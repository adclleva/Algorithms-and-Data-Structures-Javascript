# DFS PSEUDOCODE
(Recursive)
```
 DFS(vertex):
    if vertex is empty
        return (this is base case)
    add vertex to results list
    mark vertex as visited
    for each neighbor in vertex's neighbors:
       if neighbor is not visited:
          recursively call DFS on neighbor
```

## VISITING THINGS

```
{ 
  "A": true,
  "B": true,
  "D": true
}
```

## DEPTH FIRST TRAVERSAL
( Recursive )

- The function should accept a starting node
- Create a list to store the end result, to be returned at the very end
- Create an object to store visited vertices
- Create a helper function which accepts a vertex
  - The helper function should return early if the vertex is empty
  - The helper function should place the vertex it accepts into the visited object and push that vertex into the result array.
  - Loop over all of the values in the adjacencyList for that vertex
  - If any of those values have not been visited, recursively invoke the helper function with that vertex
- Invoke the helper function with the starting vertex
- Return the result array
