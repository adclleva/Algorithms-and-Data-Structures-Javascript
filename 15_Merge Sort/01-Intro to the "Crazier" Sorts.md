# Intermediate Sorting Algorithms

## Objectives

- Understand the limitations of the sorting algorithms we've learned so far
- Implement merge sort
- Implement quick sort
- Implement radix sort

## WHY LEARN THIS?

- The sorting algorithms we've learned so far don't scale well
- Try out bubble sort on an array of 100000 elements, it will take quite some time!
- We need to be able to sort large arrays more quickly

## FASTER SORTS

- There is a family of sorting algorithms that can improve time complexity from O(n ) to O(n log n)
- There's a tradeoff between efficiency and simplicity
- The more efficient algorithms are much less simple, and generally take longer to understand
- Let's dive in!
