# INSERTING A NODE
## Steps - Iteratively or Recursively

- Create a new node
- Starting at the root
  - Check if there is a root, if not - the root now becomes that new node!
  - If there is a root, check if the value of the new node is greater than or less than the value of the root
  - If it is greater 
    - Check to see if there is a node to the right
      - If there is, move to that node and repeat these steps
      - If there is not, add that node as the right property
  - If it is less
    - Check to see if there is a node to the left
      - If there is, move to that node and repeat these steps
      - If there is not, add that node as the left property
  - Return the tree
