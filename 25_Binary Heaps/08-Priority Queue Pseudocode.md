### THE SAME AS BEFORE
Class Name:

       PriorityQueue

Properties:

       values = []

### BUT ALSO...

Class Name:

       Node

Properties:

       val

       priority

- Val doesn't matter.

- Heap is constructed using Priority

### OUR PRIORITY QUEUE
- Write a Min Binary Heap - lower number means higher priority.
- Each Node has a val and a priority.  Use the priority to build the heap.
- Enqueue method accepts a value and priority, makes a new node, and puts it in the right spot based off of its priority.
- Dequeue method removes root element, returns it, and rearranges heap using priority.
