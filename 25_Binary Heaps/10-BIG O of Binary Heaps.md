# Big O of Binary Heaps
- Insertion -   O(log N)
- Removal -   O(log N)
- Search -   O(N)

## RECAP
- Binary Heaps are very useful data structures for sorting, and implementing other data structures like priority queues
- Binary Heaps are either MaxBinaryHeaps or MinBinaryHeaps with parents either being smaller or larger than their children
-With just a little bit of math, we can represent heaps using arrays!
