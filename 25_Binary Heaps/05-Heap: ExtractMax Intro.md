# REMOVING FROM A HEAP
- Remove the root
- Replace with the most recently added
- Adjust (sink down)

## SINK DOWN?

The procedure for deleting the root from the heap (effectively extracting the maximum element in a max-heap or the minimum element in a min-heap) and restoring the properties is called down-heap (also known as bubble-down, percolate-down, sift-down, trickle down, heapify-down, cascade-down, and extract-min/max).

## REMOVING (also called extractMax)
 
- Swap the first value in the values property with the last one
- Pop from the values property, so you can return the value at the end.
- Have the new root "sink down" to the correct spot...â€‹
  - Your parent index starts at 0 (the root)
  - Find the index of the left child: 2 * index + 1 (make sure its not out of bounds)
  - Find the index of the right child: 2*index + 2 (make sure its not out of bounds)
  - If the left or right child is greater than the element...swap. If both left and right children are larger, swap with the largest child.
  - The child index you swapped to now becomes the new parent index.  
  - Keep looping and swapping until neither child is larger than the element.
  - Return the old root!
