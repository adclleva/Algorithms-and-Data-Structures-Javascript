# BIG O of QUEUES
- Insertion -   O(1)
- Removal -   O(1)
- Searching -   O(N)
- Access -   O(N)

We want adding and deleting is super fast
We want to use classes instead of arrays because there are a cascading effect of indexing when adding or removing items 

## RECAP
- Queues are a FIFO data structure, all elements are first in first out.
- Queues are useful for processing tasks and are foundational for more complex data structures
- Insertion and Removal can be done in O(1)
