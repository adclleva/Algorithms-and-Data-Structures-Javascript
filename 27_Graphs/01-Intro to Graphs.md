# GRAPHS

## OBJECTIVES
Explain what a graph is
Compare and contrast different types of graphs and their use cases in the real world
Implement a graph using an adjacency list
Traverse through a graph using BFS and DFS
Compare and contrast graph traversal algorithms

## WHAT ARE GRAPHS
A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.

### Nodes + Connections

## USES FOR GRAPHS
- Social Networks
- Location / Mapping
- Routing Algorithms
- Visual Hierarchy
- File System Optimizations
- EVERYWHERE!
