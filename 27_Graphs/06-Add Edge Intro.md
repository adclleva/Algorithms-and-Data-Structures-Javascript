- This function should accept two vertices, we can call them vertex1 and vertex2
- The function should find in the adjacency list the key of vertex1 and push vertex2 to the array
- The function should find in the adjacency list the key of vertex2 and push vertex1 to the array
- Don't worry about handling errors/invalid vertices
