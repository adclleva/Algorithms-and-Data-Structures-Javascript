# REMOVING A VERTEX
- The function should accept a vertex to remove
- The function should loop as long as there are any other vertices in the adjacency list for that vertex
- Inside of the loop, call our removeEdge function with the vertex we are removing and any values in the adjacency list for that vertex
- delete the key in the adjacency list for that vertex
