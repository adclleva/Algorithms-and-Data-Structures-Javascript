# WHAT IS IT
One of the most famous and widely used algorithms around!

Finds the shortest path between two vertices on a graph

"What's the fastest way to get from point A to point B?"

## WHO WAS HE?
Edsger Dijkstra was a Dutch programmer, physicist, essayist, and all around smarty-pants

He helped to advance the field of computer science from an "art" to an academic discipline

Many of his discoveries and algorithms are still commonly used to this day.



## A QUOTE
What is the shortest way to travel from Rotterdam to Groningen, in general: from given city to given city. It is the algorithm for the shortest path, which I designed in about twenty minutes. One morning I was shopping in Amsterdam with my young fiancée, and tired, we sat down on the café terrace to drink a cup of coffee and I was just thinking about whether I could do this, and I then designed the algorithm for the shortest path. As I said, it was a twenty-minute invention. Eventually that algorithm became, to my great amazement, one of the cornerstones of my fame.

— Edsger Dijkstra, in an interview with Philip L. Frana, Communications of the ACM, 2001[2]

## WHY IS IT USEFUL?
- GPS - finding fastest route
- Network Routing - finds open shortest path for data
- Biology - used to model the spread of viruses among humans
- Airline tickets - finding cheapest route to your destination
- Many other uses!
